# Ingredients

- 1 cup (220 g) unsalted butter, softened
- 2-3 garlic cloves
- 1/4 cup parsley
- 1/4 cup Parmesan, grated

# Notes

- Do not forget to add salt because it is unsalted butter. However, if I am making garlic bread, I would add the salt after spreading on the ciabatta.
- For garlic bread, do not add too much butter to the ciabatta. A thin spread is enough.
