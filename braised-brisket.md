# Ingredients

- 1.125 kg beef brisket
- 650 g onion, sliced 1/4 inch thick
- 280 g carrot, cut into 3/4-inch dice
- 170 g celery, cut into 3/4-inch dice
- 3 medium cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup ketchup
- 1/8 cup tomato paste
- 1/2 cup dry red wine
- 1 teaspoon of thyme
- 1 bay leaves

# Method

1. Season brisket overnight
2. Sear on both sides until golden brown. About 6 minutes per side, but probably longer. Transfer brisket to platter or rimmed baking sheet, and set aside.
4. Add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic, and season with salt. Cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits, until onions are very soft and any released juices have thickened into a glaze, 25-35 minutes.
5. Stir in ketchup and tomato paste and cook, stirring, until thick, about 3 minutes. Add wine and cook until raw alcohol smell has cooked off, about 3 minutes.
6. Add thyme and bay leaves. Add brisket pieces, nestling them well in the vegetables, and add any accumulated juices. Ensure there is enough liquid as to not scorch the bottom of the cooker.
7. Seal pressure cooker and cook for at least 1 hour at high pressure and up to 1 hour 30 minutes. Choose 1 hour if your brisket pieces are closer to 1 inch thick, or 1 hour 30 minutes if your brisket is closer to 2 inches thick.
8. Rapidly release pressure cooker or allow to release naturally, then open. Transfer brisket pieces to a work surface, and let rest until cool enough to handle. Taste braising liquid and season with salt, if necessary. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves, and skim off any excess fat if present. If the braising liquid is a little too watery, you can reduce it or thicken with cornstarch.
9. Slice brisket thinly against the grain. Arrange on a platter and spoon the sauce and vegetables all over, making sure the meat is bathing in juices.
